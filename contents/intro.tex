\subsection{Expected Significance}
\label{sec:expected-significance}

Modern IoT ecosystems are wildly insecure and thus 
leave hundreds of thousands of IoT devices exposed to threats. % \cite{news}.
Even the state-of-the-art solutions 
%\cite{fernandes2016smart,tian2017smartauth, celik2018soteria,nguyen2018iotsan, chi2018crossapp, autotap, iotguard2019ndss,expat,contexiot17} 
are largely ineffective because ...
